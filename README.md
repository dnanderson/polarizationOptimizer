# polarizationOptimizer
Script that interfaces with the HEWLETT-PACKARD, 11896A, 0, V1.01 polarization controller and NI daq to get best possible polarization for experiments

The file that you want for looking at the optimization is the .py file named polarizationOpt.py, everything else has to do with the setup of
the laser and some exeriments that were done to communicate correctly with the polarization controller correctly.
